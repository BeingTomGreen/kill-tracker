## TODO

- Get updating Task to work via the API
- Filter Slayer Monsters depending on selected Slayer Master
- Add Interfaces for Repositories
- Pull validation code from MGC, possibly throw it in a package
- Tests?!
- Stop Seeds running on production

## NOTES

- Currently the SlayerTaskAPIController manully hacks in a user login, this needs clearing up at somepoint. On MGC I've written an API Auth filter, probably makes ssense to bring that over..
